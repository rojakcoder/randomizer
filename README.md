# Randomizer

Randomizer is a lightweight Web app to help pick random items. It is a single page application (SPA) written with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>.

## Getting started

After installing the necessary packages (`npm install`), run the build script to create the application.

The app can then be served using any Web server. A fast and simple way is to run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
